# Titanic data

## Example: titanic data
We start this lecture with a data set that logs the survival of passengers on board of the disastrous maiden voyage of the ocean liner Titanic
```{r}
titanic <- read.csv(file = "titanic.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
titanic %>% head
```

## Inspect the data set
```{r}
str(titanic)
```

## What sources of information
We have information on the following features.

Our outcome/dependent variable:

- Survived: yes or no

Some potential predictors:

- Sex: the passenger's gender coded as `c(male, female)`
- Pclass: the class the passenger traveled in
- Age: the passenger's age in years
- Siblings.Spouses.Aboard: if siblings or spouses were also aboard
- Parents.Children.Aboard: if the passenger's parents or children were aboard

and more. 

## Hypothetically

We can start investigating if there are patterns in this data that are related to the survival probability. 

For example, we could hypothesize based on the crede "women and children first" that 

- `Age` relates to the probability of survival in that younger passengers have a higher probability of survival
- `Sex` relates to survival in that females have a higher probability of survival

Based on socio-economic status, we could hypothesize that 

- `Pclass` relates to the probability of survival in that higher travel class leads to a higher probability of survival

And so on. 

# A quick investigation

## Is `Age` related?
```{r fig.height = 3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent'), fig.align='center'}
titanic %>% ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Survived)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", 
    method.args = list(family = "binomial"), 
    se = FALSE) + xlim(-1, 100) + theme_minimal()
```

## Inspecting the data
```{r}
titanic %$% table(Pclass, Survived)
```

It seems that the higher the class (i.e. `1 > 2 > 3`), the higher the probability of survival.

We can verify this
```{r}
titanic %$% table(Pclass, Survived) %>% prop.table(margin = 1) %>% round(digits = 2)
```

# A more thorough inspection

## `Survived ~ Age`
```{r fig.height=2.3, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent'), fig.align='center'}
titanic %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) + 
  facet_wrap(~Survived) + theme_clean()
```

The distribution of `Age` for the survivors (`TRUE`) is different from the distribution of `Age` for the non-survivors (`FALSE`). Especially at the younger end there is a point mass for the survivors, which indicates that children have a higher probability of survival. However, it is not dramatically different. 

## `Survived ~ Sex`
```{r fig.height=2.3, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent'), fig.align='center'}
titanic %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sex)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Sex)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Survived) + theme_clean()
```

Wow! These distributions are very different! Females seem to have a much higher probability of survival. 

## `Survived ~ Pclass`
```{r fig.height=2.3, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent'), fig.align='center'}
titanic %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Pclass)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Pclass)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Survived) + theme_clean()
```

There is a very apparent difference between the distributions of the survivors and non-survivors over the classes. For example, we see that in 1st and 2nd class there are more survivors than non-survivors, while in the third class this relation is opposite. 

## Edit the data
```{r}
titanic %<>% 
  mutate(Pclass = factor(Pclass, levels = c(3, 2, 1), ordered = FALSE))
```

The `Pclass` column is now correctly coded as a factor. We ignore the ordering for now

```{r fig.height=2, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent'), fig.align='center'}
titanic %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Pclass)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Pclass)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Survived) + theme_clean()
```

## Titanic with interactions
```{r}
fit.interaction <- titanic %$% glm(Survived ~ Age * Sex * Pclass, 
                                   family = binomial(link = "logit"))
fit.interaction %>% summary %>% .$coefficients
```

## Interactions
An interaction occurs when the (causal) effect of one predictor on the outcome depends on the level of the (causal) effect of another predictor.

E.g. the relation between body temperature and air temperature depends on the species. 

## Visualizing the effects
To illustrate, I will limit this investigation to `Age` and `Pclass` for males only.

- We can use the `predict` function to illustrate the conditional probabilities within each class

To do so, we need to create a `new` data frame that has all the combinations of predictors we need. 
```{r}
male <- data.frame(Pclass = factor(rep(c(1, 2, 3), c(80, 80, 80))), 
                  Age = rep(1:80, times = 3),
                  Sex = rep("male", times = 240))
female <- data.frame(Pclass = factor(rep(c(1, 2, 3), c(80, 80, 80))), 
                  Age = rep(1:80, times = 3),
                  Sex = rep("female", times = 240))
new <- rbind(female, male)
new <- cbind(new, 
             predict(fit.interaction, newdata = new, 
                     type = "link", se = TRUE))
```

## Our `new` data set
```{r}
head(new)
```

## Adding the predicted probabilities
There are two simple approaches to obtain the predicted probabilities. First, we could simply ask for the predicted response:
```{r}
new$prob <- plogis(new$fit)
head(new)
```

## Adding confidence intervals
```{r}
new %<>% 
  mutate(lower = plogis(fit - 1.96 * se.fit),
         upper = plogis(fit + 1.96 * se.fit))

head(new)
```

## What do we have?
A data frame with simulated `Pclass` and `Age` for males.

```{r}
new %>% summary()
```

## Visualizing the effects: link
```{r fig.height=3.5, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent'), fig.align='center'}
new %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = fit)) + 
  geom_line(aes(colour = Pclass), lwd = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~ Sex)
```

## Visualizing the effects: probabilities
```{r fig.height=3.5, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent'), fig.align='center'}
new %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = prob)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper, fill = Pclass), alpha = .2) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = Pclass), lwd = 1) + ylab("Probability of Survival") +
  facet_wrap(~ Sex)
```
